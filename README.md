A Cloudflare Worker that aggregates and searches across multiple data sources including Snowflake, Databricks, ONS, Defra, Agrimetrics, AWS Marketplace, data.gov.uk, and Datarade. This service provides a unified search interface for government and commercial data marketplaces.

## Features

- Unified search interface across multiple data sources
- Real-time data aggregation with parallel processing
- Interleaved results from all sources
- Responsive HTML output with GOV.UK Design System
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Optimized performance with concurrent API requests
- Intelligent caching strategy for improved response times
- TypeScript-based implementation with strict type checking

## Performance

The service is optimized for speed and efficiency:
- All data source requests are executed in parallel using Promise.all
- No sequential waiting between API calls
- Reduced total response time
- Graceful handling of slow or failed requests
- Results are interleaved as they become available
- Consistent date formatting across all sources

### Caching Strategy
The service implements an intelligent caching strategy using Cloudflare's caching:
- Aggressive caching enabled for all requests (`cacheEverything: true`)
- Custom cache keys based on search parameters for efficient cache hits
- Custom cache durations based on response status:
  - Successful responses (200-299) are cached for 2 weeks
  - Not Found responses (404) are cached for 1 second
  - Server errors (500-599) are not cached
- Cache is applied consistently across all data sources
- Improves response times for repeated searches
- Reduces load on upstream APIs
- Provides resilience against temporary API outages
- Caches all content types, not just static assets

#### Cache Keys
Each data source uses a unique cache key format:
- Snowflake: `snowflake-{search_term}`
- ONS: `ons-{search_term}`
- Defra: `defra-{search_term}`
- Agrimetrics: `agrimetrics-{search_term}`
- Databricks: Uses default URL-based caching

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Wrangler CLI for Cloudflare Workers
- Understanding of Cloudflare's caching mechanisms
- TypeScript knowledge

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for each data source integration
- Integration tests for the combined search functionality
- Error handling tests
- URL construction tests
- Response formatting tests
- Cache configuration tests

### Deployment
Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Performance Considerations
When developing new features or modifying existing ones:
- Maintain the parallel request architecture
- Utilize appropriate cache settings for new API integrations
- Consider cache implications when modifying API calls
- Test performance with and without cached responses
- Be mindful of aggressive caching when implementing new endpoints
- Consider cache bypass strategies for time-sensitive data
- Use appropriate cache keys for new data sources
- Ensure consistent date formatting across all sources
- Handle API timeouts gracefully

## Error Handling

The service implements graceful degradation:
- If any individual data source fails, other sources continue to function
- Parallel request architecture ensures a single slow API doesn't block other results
- Invalid search parameters are handled gracefully
- Network errors are caught and logged
- Empty results are handled appropriately
- Timeouts and connection issues are handled gracefully
- Caching provides resilience against temporary API failures
- All errors are logged for monitoring
